##  One more thing

if you have trouble , you can read the [troubleshooting]() ,and most of the issues can be fixd.<br><br>

in fact , i made this by reading [Opencore Vanilla Desktop Guide](https://khronokernel.github.io/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/), you can also make your own EFI by yourself.
<br><br>

i will update my EFI time to time , both kexts„ÄÅ efi drivers and opencore will be updated togethor.<br><br>

* wifi and bluetooth can't work! (intel just can't)<br>
